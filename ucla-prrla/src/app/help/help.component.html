            <p>PRL provides access to thousands of digital images, documents, audio and
              video recordings from the academic and research libraries with PRRLA membership across the Pacific Rim.</p>
            <p>We know all of these works can be overwhelming, so below are some frequently asked questions about
              finding, using, and obtaining more information about these materials.</p>

        <a name="content"></a><p><strong>How do I find content on PRL?</strong></p>
              <p>Currently PRL offers three main ways into the collections:</p>
              <p>• Search: Find items and related collections using keyword searches. See below for search tips.</p>
              <p>• Browse by institution: Explore the libraries, archives, and museums that have contributed collections
                to PRL. <a [routerLink]="['/institutions']">View all PRRLA Institutions</a>.</p>
              <p>• Browse by collection: Collections are groups of items related by format, topic, or creator. They
                provide context for materials. Browse collections from A-Z, or via institution.</p>

<a name="tips"></a> <p><strong>Do you have any search tips?</strong></p>
              <p>We sure do!</p>
              <p>• Exact phrase: To find items with an exact phrase, use quotes [" "] around your keyword phrase. For example: "pacific rim" or "Malcolm X"
              </p>
              <p>• Truncation: An asterisk [*] can be used as a wildcard to replace one or many characters. For example: farm* will retrieve farm, farms, farming, farmhouse, farmers' market, etc.
            </p>
              <p>• Boolean search: Our search uses Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). Entering a multiple keyword search will work like Boolean OR. Results will be returned only when either of the keywords appear. For example: cat dog will retrieve items with either cat or dog. Cat NOT dog will retrieve items with the word cat, but not dog. Cat AND dog will provide search results that have both cat and dog.
              </p>
              <p>• Filters: Use filters on, contributing institution, collection, author, and decade to further refine a search and drill down into items of interest. If you are using a desktop or laptop monitor, your search results will automatically refresh when you use the filters.
              </p><p>• Sort: Organize your search results according to what’s important to you. Sort by relevance (the prevalence of your search terms in item information), title alphabetically and reverse, or date.
              </p>

            <a name="prdla"></a><p><strong>When I do a search on PRL, I get different results than I used to on PRDLA. What's going on?
              </strong></p>
              <p>The first generation of PRL was hosted and maintained by the University of Hong Kong Library for over 10 years. On behalf of PRRLA, the UCLA Library has taken over these duties as of July 2016. UCLA Library will help implement and maintain the next generation PRL to enhance resource discovery.
              </p> <p>Starting Fall 2017 UCLA has changed the appearance, functionality, and its underlying infrastructure— making PRL faster,, and easier to use. 
                However, not all the items that were in the original PRL site are or will be in the new site.  We are in the processing of migrating records that conform to the new <a href="http://pr-rla.org/wp-content/uploads/20170314-Draft-PRL-Collection-Development-and-Metadata-Policy.pdf" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" >Collection Policy</a> endorsed by the PRRLA Steering Committee.  The original PRRLA sign site will remain accessible up until Spring 2018.
</p>
              <p>If you notice that your searches on this site yield unexpected results, please let us know. We are working with a new search technology and can continue to improve it with your feedback.
